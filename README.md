Web Blocks
==========

A WebGL application for building worlds and learning programming. Inspired by Minecraft Pi Edition.

See it in action here: [http://webblocks.uk/]

Controls
--------

Move forwards / backwards: W and S

Move sideways: A and D

Look around: Arrow keys

Code editor: Escape key

Notes
-----

This app will only work on modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and on computers with 3D graphics chips. This is only a demo at the moment so there will be bugs. I hope to eventually grow it into a useful educational tool. Help is always welcome.

Includes experimental support for Google Cardboard!

Building
--------

Requires NodeJS. Once installed, run these commands.

  - npm -g install gulp
  - npm install
  - gulp

Then point your browser at: http://localhost:8000/
